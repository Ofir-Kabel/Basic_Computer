# Basic_Computer(without I/O)

I worte a VHDL code for the basic computer Morris Mano is representing in his book "computer system architecture"
the computer structure:
computer
-Memory 16x4096
-CPU
--control unit : includes control legs of the registers,Alu,Bus and the state machine of the instruction code
--common Bus system : include registers,ALU and the Bus line

the computer work on FSM machine
1.fetch
2.decode
3.indirect/direct
4.operation..

I attached for each operation a binary value so it very clear when an instruction is exicute on the simulation and so on.. 

during this projects I learned a lot about integration between number of components with one clock and parallel operation that need to work simultaneous.
I almost complete the projects I need to write the code for the I/O operation and to change the program to check it..(just need to extand the state machine)

there is two programs on the memory on of subtraction between two numbers and the other is an extantion from 16bit to 32bit of addition operation.
